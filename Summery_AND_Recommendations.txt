Recommendations:
................

Fix the bugs: The app should be thoroughly tested to identify and fix any bugs that are causing incorrect tracking of exercise metrics or crashes. This will improve the overall user experience and help to build trust with users.

Add missing features: Based on user feedback, the app could benefit from additional features such as water intake tracking and the ability to create custom workouts. Adding these features will make the app more versatile and appealing to a wider range of users.

Improve social features: Fitness tracking can be a social activity, and users may be more motivated to stay on track if they can share their progress and compete with friends. Consider adding social features, such as the ability to connect with friends, share progress, and compete on leaderboards.

Incorporate user feedback: Encourage users to provide feedback on the app and take that feedback into account when making updates and improvements. This will help to build a community around the app and ensure that it continues to meet the needs and expectations of its users.
